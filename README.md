### üöÄ Getting Started.

1. Clone and/ or download the project locally.
1. Navigate to the projects root directory and install its dependencies: `npm i`
1. You‚Äôre ready to code! Start your development environment `npm run dev`.

_Note: This project is still in beta and a sample dataset has not been created. To render the `session` page locally, you can create an array of prompt objects and use them instead of the data from the `getServerSideProps`. Example: `const prompts = Array.from({ length: 5 } , () => ({id: 0, prompt: 'How do you feel today?'}))._
